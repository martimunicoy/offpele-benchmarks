# Benchmarks
This folder holds all the benchmarks that are designed to evaluate the
integration of Open Force Field in PELE. They are classified in subfolder
according to the property that they analyze.

## Content
- `rotamers`: It contains tests to evaluate the creation of the rotamer
libraries.
- `geometry`: It contains tests to evaluate the minimized structures
of small molecules obtained with PELE and the parameter-assignment from
the Open Force Field toolkit.
- `solvent`: It contains tests to evaluate the energetic estimations
of the OBC implicit solvent of PELE for small molecules.


## Data
The `data` folder contains the datasets to be used by the tests.
